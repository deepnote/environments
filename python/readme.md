# What is Deepnote Python?
Deepnote Python is a set of Docker images tailored for use in the Deepnote platform. These images are based on the official [Python Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/_/python) and include additional binaries and configurations to enhance the user experience within Deepnote. They are designed to simplify development workflows, especially for data science projects, by providing pre-configured environments that are ready to use.

# How to Use This Image

## Create Custom Dockerfile for Deepnote Use
To create a custom Dockerfile using Deepnote's Python image, you can start with the following template:

```dockerfile
ARG PYTHON_VERSION=3.9
FROM deepnote/python:$PYTHON_VERSION

#Determine the Python version and set the version-specifications file
ARG PYTHON_VERSION

COPY requirements.txt ./
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt -c https://tk.deepnote.com/constraints${PYTHON_VERSION}.txt
```

This Dockerfile uses the `deepnote/python:3.9` image as a base and installs Python packages specified in requirements.txt. The use of constraints from `https://tk.deepnote.com/constraints<python_version>.txt` ensures compatibility and stability of package installations.

# Additional Information
These images are intended to serve as a starting point for creating reproducible and scalable data science environments in Deepnote. They include various utilities and binaries that streamline workflows, such as Jupyter support, data visualization tools, and more.
